# Matrix Flatten

Program that generates a random 3D matrix  
with size N x M x P (taken as user input) 
and than Flatten the matrix into 1D vector.


## How to use ?
1 - The program first takes the 3D dimensions of the matrix
N x M x P.                                                        
2 - The Program will generate a random 3D matrix with the specified dimensions and the program will ask if you want to display it or not.   
3 - After generating the random 3D matrix the program will flatten the matrix into 1D vector and will ask if you want to dispaly it or not.     
4 - Now we have a 3D matrix indexed by i,j,k and a flattened version of it (1D) indexed by y.
The program will ask for the 3d index (i,j,k) that you want to access and than it will convert the i,j,k index into one index (y) so that we can use it to access the flattened matrix.         
5 - The output of the program is the new index y and the indexed item from the flattened matrix and the from the original matrix (they must be the same).

## Project Structure
The Project consists of two file:       
- main.py : which is the main file where the project is started from and it contains all user inputs and outputs.

- matrix.py : contains Matrix class which contains all matrix related functions.
